# Snake in 100 programming languages
The goal is to produce implementations of the classic Snake game in 100 different programming languages

Minimal Criteria for completed Snake implementation:

- The full game area can be divided into square blocks of resolution 27x27 with a border of 1 block in thickness, meaning that the playable game area has resolution of 25x25
- The initial snake takes the form of 10 blocks
- Food is placed randomly in the playable game area one at a time and is 1 block in size
- Up, Down, Left, Right arrow keys control the snake
- Speed increases by a factor per 10 food blocks eaten
- The two sound clips in the root of the src directory are utilized at the appropriate events
- A scoring system exists where each food block eaten by the snake contributes 1 point
- Anything outside of the minimal requirements outlined in this section, must be located separeately (the core version should be imported and expanded upon)

Bonus points for:

- The game paramaters above can be customized in game and saved to a configuration file, with an option to revert to the defaults described in the minimal criteria section
- Controller/Gamepad support
